# Welcome to planSmart

This app was created by Andrew Huang, Daniel Kim, Matthew Yen and Stella Wang for nwHacks 2021.

Our idea was to create an app that will allow the user to calculate how much money to save to afford their dream item and take into account the net present value of their money.

The app allows users to login with their email and keep track of multiple goals at the same time.

We implemented the app using React for the front-end and FireBase for the back-end.
